            <h2>Choose your trip</h2>
            <article>
                <p> We choose hotels which offer a great location, a high standard of comfort and quality, and a solid
                    value
                    to our
                    guests. These inns offer a superbly satisfying mix of a welcoming atmosphere, traditional cuisine,
                    and
                    authentic charm.
                    They are typically small, independently-owned properties which reflect the character and hospitality
                    of
                    the surrounding
                    alpine community. We know the owners personally, have a longstanding
                    relationship with them, and we find they bend over backwards to provide our guests with an
                    exceptional
                    experience. </p>
